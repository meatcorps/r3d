# R3D – 3D Extension Library for raylib

<img align="left" src="https://github.com/Bigfoot71/r3d/blob/master/logo.png" width="100" hspace="20">
<br>
R3D is an extension library for <a href="https://www.raylib.com/">raylib</a> that expands its 3D capabilities, including rendering, lighting, kinematics, mesh utilities, and related helpers, without turning raylib into a full engine.

## Key Features

- **Hybrid Renderer**: Deferred pipeline with forward rendering for transparency.
- **Advanced Materials**: Complete PBR material system (Burley/SchlickGGX)
- **Custom Shaders**: Support for surface shaders (materials/decals), sky and screen shaders.
- **Dynamic Lighting**: Directional, spot, and omni lights with soft shadows
- **Image-Based Lighting**: Supports environment IBL and reflection probes.
- **Post-Processing**: SSAO, SSGI, SSR, DoF, bloom, fog, tonemapping, and more
- **Kinematics Support**: Basic kinematic system with capsule and mesh-based colliders.
- **Mesh Utilities**: Mesh generation, manipulation, and helper utilities.
- **Model Loading**: Assimp integration with animations and mesh generation
- **Performance**: Built-in frustum culling, instanced rendering, and more

## Requirements

To build R3D, you must have:
- **raylib 6.0+** (optionally provided as a submodule)
- **Assimp 6.0.2+** (optionally provided as a submodule)
- **Python 3.6+** (used to process shaders during compilation)

To use R3D, the required specifications are:
- **OpenGL 3.3+** (with support for `GL_ARB_texture_cube_map_array`)

## Bindings

Here is a list with all the ports available:

| Name | R3D Version | Language | License |
| --- | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| [r3d-cs](https://github.com/graphnode/r3d-cs) | **0.11.0** | [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)) | Zlib |
| [ray4laz_r3d](https://github.com/GuvaCode/ray4laz_r3d) | **0.11.0** | [FreePascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Pascal) | MIT |

_Feel free to send a PR if you know of any binding/wrapper not in this list._

## Installation

If you don't know how to start and want to try it quickly:
```bash
git clone --depth 1 --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Bigfoot71/r3d
cd r3d
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DR3D_RAYLIB_VENDORED=ON -DR3D_ASSIMP_VENDORED=ON
cmake --build .
```

Or you can use [r3dStarter](https://github.com/jensroth-git/r3dStarter) made by [Jens Roth](https://github.com/jensroth-git).

## Quick Start

```c
#include <r3d/r3d.h>
#include <raymath.h>

int main(void)
{
    InitWindow(800, 600, "R3D Example");
    SetTargetFPS(60);

    R3D_Init(800, 600);

    // Create scene objects
    R3D_Mesh mesh = R3D_GenMeshSphere(1.0f, 16, 32);
    R3D_Material material = R3D_GetDefaultMaterial();

    // Setup lighting
    R3D_Light light = R3D_CreateDirLight((Vector3) {-1, -1, -1}, WHITE, 1.0f);

    // Camera setup
    Camera3D camera = {
        .position = {3, 3, 3},
        .target = {0, 0, 0},
        .up = {0, 1, 0},
        .fovy = 60.0f,
        .projection = CAMERA_PERSPECTIVE
    };

    // Main loop
    while (!WindowShouldClose()) {
        UpdateCamera(&camera, CAMERA_ORBITAL);
        BeginDrawing();
          R3D_Begin(camera);
            R3D_PushLight(light);
            R3D_DrawMesh(mesh, material, Vector3Zero(), 1.0f);
          R3D_End();
        EndDrawing();
    }

    R3D_UnloadMesh(mesh);
    R3D_Close();
    CloseWindow();
    return 0;
}
```
